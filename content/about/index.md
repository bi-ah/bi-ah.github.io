    <h1>About</h1>

    <p class="about-lead">
      I’m Bilal Ahmed — an engineering leader building secure, reliable, audit-ready products across payments, security automation, and compliance-native SaaS.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over 20+ years, I’ve led distributed teams and shipped high-impact platforms from early architecture through scale.
      My work sits at the intersection of <strong>complex systems</strong>, <strong>risk</strong>, and <strong>execution</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most recently at <strong>Pagos</strong> (US fintech), I led teams delivering network tokenization, account updater, and high-volume payment data ingestion on AWS —
      processing millions of card-not-present transactions per month, improving approval rates (up to 7.5%), and reducing recurring declines (~33%)
      while staying aligned with PCI DSS and SOC 2 expectations.

<div class="about-body">
  <h2>What I’m building now</h2>
  <p>
    I’m co-founding <strong>SYNVRA</strong>, a compliance-by-design LIMS and validation automation platform for regulated labs
    (21 CFR Part 11, ALCOA+, ISO/IEC 17025). I also run founder-led studios (Aquilinesoft, AegisPeak) delivering software,
    data, and cybersecurity solutions for enterprise and public-sector clients.
  </p>

  <h2>How I work</h2>
  <p>
    I’m pursuing an Executive MBA at Quantic (~55% complete) to sharpen strategy and finance alongside engineering leadership.
    I’m comfortable switching between <strong>hands-on architect</strong> and <strong>people leader</strong> roles, partnering with Product,
    Data, and Security to ship outcomes — not just features.
  </p>

  <h2>Strengths</h2>
  <ul class="about-strengths">
    <li>High-volume CNP payments: network tokenization, account updater, and risk-aware flows</li>
    <li>Cloud-native AWS systems with strong observability, reliability, and security</li>
    <li>Compliance-ready architectures: PCI DSS / SOC 2 aligned controls, logging, and evidence trails</li>
    <li>Building and leading distributed engineering teams across time zones</li>
    <li>Translating business goals into clear technical roadmaps and execution plans</li>
  </ul>
