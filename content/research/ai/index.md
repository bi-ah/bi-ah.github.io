# AI & Intelligent Systems

This section is my working library on AI topics I’m exploring—especially the parts that matter in production: **reliability, evaluation, safety, cost, and integration**. Expect short posts, experiments, and occasional deeper write-ups.

- Notes on **AI agents**: orchestration, tools, memory, and failure modes
- Practical evaluation: **metrics, test sets, regression checks, and “what good looks like”**
- Deployment patterns: **observability, latency/cost trade-offs, guardrails, and secure integration**
