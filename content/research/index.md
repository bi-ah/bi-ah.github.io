    <h3>A living notebook of ideas I’m testing in the real world—small posts, practical experiments, and deeper write-ups as they mature.</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Short notes on focused problems and patterns I’m learning</li>
      <li>Experiments, prototypes, and lessons from building production systems</li>
      <li>Longer research briefs when a topic deserves depth and rigor</li>
