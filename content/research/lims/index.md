# LIMS & Regulated Systems

This section captures my research notes and practical patterns for building **Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS)** and other **regulated, audit-ready platforms**. I’m focused on designs that hold up under validation, change control, and real operational pressure.

- Implementation notes for **21 CFR Part 11**, **ALCOA+**, and **ISO 17025**-style expectations (practical, not theoretical)
- Architecture patterns for **audit trails, e-signatures, data integrity, validation evidence**, and controlled releases
- Small write-ups on workflows: **sample lifecycle, instrument integration, SOP mapping, exceptions, and reporting**
