- **EM execution:** ran Agile delivery end-to-end (**Jira**, Scrum ceremonies, sprint planning, grooming, retros, **Linear**, **Clickup**) and maintained predictable releases with a strong quality bar.  
- **Release & quality leadership:** operated weekly deployments using **Terraform (IaC)** and **GitHub Actions CI/CD**, partnering tightly with **QA** and enforcing **unit, functional, and end-to-end testing** gates.  
- **Global reliability:** built a sustainable on-call model—scheduled **PagerDuty** rotations across time zones, improved observability, and drove incident hygiene (runbooks + postmortems).

**Platforms served merchants/brands including:** **Adobe, Eventbrite, GoFundMe, Groupon, Wix, LastPass, Crocs** (plus additional payment platforms and high-volume digital merchants).
