# Professional Summary

Senior Engineering Leader in **payments, security, and B2B SaaS platforms** with 20+ years of experience designing and delivering secure, scalable systems. Led **network tokenization, account updater, and high-volume payment data ingestion** at Pagos, handling millions of card-not-present transactions per month and improving approval rates by up to **7.5%** while cutting recurring declines by **~33%**.  

Currently CEO & Co-Founder at **SYNVRA**, an early-stage, compliance-by-design **LIMS & validation automation** platform for regulated labs (21 CFR Part 11, ALCOA+, ISO 17025). Through **AegisPeak** (AI-driven cybersecurity) and **Aquilinesoft** (software & data studio), I have led cybersecurity and software consulting projects for enterprise and government organisations, including UNDP/GEF and Pakistan’s Ministry of Climate Change. These founder studios are low-bandwidth, flexible ventures that have historically run alongside full-time roles; I am now actively seeking a primary **Senior Engineering Manager / Director of Engineering** position and can scale these ventures around it (nights/weekends or advisory only).  

Blend of **hands-on architecture** (.NET, Python, AWS) with **distributed team leadership** across North America, Europe, the Middle East, and South Asia. Comfortable working directly with founders, product, risk, security, and compliance leaders to ship roadmap outcomes, not just features.
