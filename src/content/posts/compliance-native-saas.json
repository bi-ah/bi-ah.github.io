  "body": "## The Problem with Bolt-On Compliance\n\nMost startups treat compliance as something to worry about later. This is a mistake that costs millions in technical debt.\n\n## What is Compliance-Native?\n\nCompliance-native means building with regulatory requirements as first-class architectural concerns:\n\n- **Audit Logging** - Immutable, complete, from day one\n- **Access Control** - Role-based, principle of least privilege\n- **Data Classification** - Know where sensitive data lives\n- **Encryption** - At rest and in transit, key management\n\n## Practical Implementation\n\n### Start with the Data Model\n\nEvery table should answer:\n- What data classification?\n- Who can access?\n- What's the retention policy?\n- How is access logged?\n\n### Build Compliance into CI/CD\n\n- Security scanning in every PR\n- Compliance checks as gate conditions\n- Automated evidence collection\n\n## The ROI of Early Investment\n\nCompanies that build compliance-native:\n- Pass audits faster (weeks vs months)\n- Spend less on remediation\n- Win enterprise deals earlier\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCompliance is not a feature—it's an architectural decision. Make it early.",
