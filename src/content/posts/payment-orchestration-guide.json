  "body": "## Introduction\n\nPayment orchestration has become essential for any business processing significant transaction volumes. In this guide, we'll explore the key principles and practical implementation strategies.\n\n## What is Payment Orchestration?\n\nPayment orchestration is the practice of routing transactions through multiple payment service providers (PSPs) to optimize for success rate, cost, and speed.\n\n## Key Benefits\n\n1. **Higher Approval Rates** - Route to the best PSP for each transaction type\n2. **Lower Costs** - Negotiate better rates with competition\n3. **Better Redundancy** - Failover when one provider has issues\n4. **Geographic Optimization** - Use local acquirers for better rates\n\n## Architecture Considerations\n\n### Routing Engine\n\nYour routing engine should consider:\n- Card BIN and issuing country\n- Transaction amount and currency\n- Historical success rates\n- Current PSP health\n\n### Retry Logic\n\nImplement intelligent retry with:\n- Exponential backoff\n- Different PSP on retry\n- Decline code analysis\n\n## Conclusion\n\nPayment orchestration is no longer optional for serious payment operations. Start with clear metrics and iterate based on data.",
