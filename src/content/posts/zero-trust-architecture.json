In a world of cloud services, remote work, and API-first architectures, zero-trust is the only viable approach.\n\n## Core Principles\n\n### Never Trust, Always Verify\n\nEvery request must be authenticated and authorized, regardless of source.\n\n### Least Privilege Access\n\nGrant minimum necessary permissions, just-in-time.\n\n### Assume Breach\n\nDesign systems assuming attackers are already inside.\n\n## Implementation Roadmap\n\n### Phase 1: Identity Foundation\n\n- Strong identity provider\n- MFA everywhere\n- Service identities for machines\n\n### Phase 2: Network Segmentation\n\n- Micro-segmentation\n- Service mesh with mTLS\n- Network policies\n\n### Phase 3: Continuous Verification\n\n- Real-time risk assessment\n- Behavioral analytics\n- Automated response\n\n## Financial Services Considerations\n\n- Regulatory requirements (PCI-DSS, SOC2)\n- Third-party vendor access\n- Customer data protection\n\n## Conclusion\n\nZero-trust is a journey, not a destination. Start with identity and iterate.",
