  "description": "Led design and delivery of an AI-powered Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) platform integrating SIEM telemetry and automated incident response.",
  "fullDescription": "An enterprise-grade SOAR platform combining SIEM data streams, threat intelligence feeds, and AI-driven analytics to automate security operations. The system provides real-time threat detection, automated playbook execution, and coordinated incident response.",
  "problem": "Security teams were overwhelmed by alert fatigue, false positives, and the sheer volume of threats. Manual incident response couldn't scale with the frequency of automated attacks.",
  "constraints": "Required integration with heterogeneous SIEM solutions and data sources. Must reduce response time while maintaining accuracy and minimizing false positives.",
  "approach": "Designed an AI layer that sits atop SIEM data repositories, applying machine learning for threat classification and automated response orchestration. Built playbooks for common threat patterns.",
  "tradeoffs": "Chose explainable AI models over black-box approaches to support security analyst review. Accepted gradual automation rollout to build operator confidence.",
  "execution": "12-month engagement leading design and delivery. Collaborated on patent documentation for AI-driven SOAR innovations.",
  "outcomes": "Enhanced real-time threat detection capabilities and reduced incident response times. Contributed to patented security frameworks for automated threat response.",
