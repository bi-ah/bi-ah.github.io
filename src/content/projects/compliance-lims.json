  "slug": "compliance-lims",
  "description": "Defining product vision and architecture for a compliance-by-design LIMS and validation automation platform for regulated laboratories (21 CFR Part 11, ALCOA+, ISO 17025).",
  "fullDescription": "A next-generation Laboratory Information Management System built with regulatory compliance as a first-class architectural concern. Designed for ISO 17025 / GLP/GMP / FDA 21 CFR Part 11 labs, featuring audit-ready records, electronic signatures, and full traceability by default.",
  "problem": "Existing LIMS solutions treat compliance as an afterthought, leading to expensive retrofitting, audit failures, and operational friction for regulated laboratories.",
  "constraints": "Must satisfy 21 CFR Part 11 electronic records requirements, ALCOA+ data integrity principles, and ISO/IEC 17025:2017 technical requirements. Zero tolerance for data integrity gaps.",
  "approach": "Architecting with compliance patterns embedded at the data layer: immutable audit logs, e-signatures, version control, and traceability baked into the core data model rather than bolted on.",
  "tradeoffs": "Prioritizing regulatory rigor over feature velocity. Choosing PostgreSQL and event-sourcing patterns for guaranteed audit trails.",
  "execution": "Currently in development. Defining roadmap, core workflows, and data model around ALCOA+ and ISO/IEC 17025:2017 requirements.",
  "outcomes": "In active development. Positioning for MENAP laboratory market as 'compliance-by-design LIMS + validation acceleration' rather than generic LIMS vendor.",
