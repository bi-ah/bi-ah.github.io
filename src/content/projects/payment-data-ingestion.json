  "description": "Built real-time payment data ingestion pipelines processing millions of transactions monthly, powering analytics, risk dashboards, and merchant insights.",
  "fullDescription": "A high-volume data ingestion platform that processes payment transaction data from global PSPs in near real-time. The system powers analytics dashboards, risk scoring, and actionable merchant insights.",
  "problem": "Merchants lacked visibility into transaction performance across PSPs. Data was fragmented and delayed, preventing timely decision-making on approval optimization.",
  "constraints": "Must handle millions of transactions monthly with low latency. Required integration with diverse PSP data formats and guarantee data consistency for financial reporting.",
  "approach": "Built event-driven ingestion pipelines using AWS Lambda, Kafka, and SQS. Implemented data lake architecture with Athena for ad-hoc queries and Redshift for structured analytics.",
  "tradeoffs": "Chose eventual consistency for analytics to prioritize ingestion throughput. Accepted higher storage costs for raw data retention supporting compliance requirements.",
  "execution": "Iterative development as part of Pagos platform. Led architecture decisions, code reviews, and production support for reliability.",
  "outcomes": "Enabled near real-time reporting and operational decision-making for international merchants. Powered risk dashboards and merchant-facing insights.",
