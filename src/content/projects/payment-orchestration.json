  "description": "Built a multi-PSP payment routing engine with intelligent retry logic, achieving 15%+ approval rate lift and 40% decline reduction.",
  "fullDescription": "A comprehensive payment orchestration layer that sits between merchants and multiple payment service providers (PSPs). The system intelligently routes transactions based on success probability, cost optimization, and issuer-specific patterns.",
  "problem": "Enterprise merchants were experiencing high decline rates and suboptimal approval rates due to reliance on single PSPs.",
  "constraints": "Had to maintain sub-100ms latency, support 50+ PSP integrations, and ensure PCI-DSS Level 1 compliance.",
  "approach": "Built a routing engine with ML-based decline prediction, implemented cascading retry logic, and created a unified API layer.",
  "tradeoffs": "Chose eventual consistency for analytics to prioritize transaction speed. Accepted higher infrastructure costs for redundancy.",
  "execution": "6-month development cycle with 3 engineers. Phased rollout starting with low-risk transaction types.",
  "outcomes": "15%+ approval rate lift, 40% decline reduction, $2M+ additional revenue captured annually for initial clients.",

  "whatIdImprove": "Would invest more in real-time monitoring dashboards earlier. Would also build a self-service configuration UI for routing rules.",
