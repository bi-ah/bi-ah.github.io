  "description": "Architected organization-wide zero-trust security implementation with identity-based access controls.",
  "fullDescription": "A comprehensive zero-trust architecture implementation covering network segmentation, identity verification, and continuous authorization for all system access.",
  "problem": "Traditional perimeter-based security was insufficient for distributed teams and cloud-native infrastructure.",
  "constraints": "Must not significantly impact developer productivity. Required support for legacy systems.",
  "approach": "Implemented identity-aware proxy, service mesh with mTLS, and just-in-time access provisioning.",
  "tradeoffs": "Accepted higher operational complexity for improved security posture. Chose gradual rollout over big-bang migration.",
  "execution": "18-month implementation across 200+ services. Phased approach starting with highest-risk systems.",
  "outcomes": "Zero security incidents post-implementation, 90% reduction in standing privileges, passed all external security audits.",
