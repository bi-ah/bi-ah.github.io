  "executiveSummary": "I am a technical founder and engineering leader with 20+ years of experience building secure, scalable products in payments, cybersecurity, and regulated SaaS. I previously served as a Senior Engineering Manager and technical lead at Pagos, a US-based fintech where I worked on network tokenization, global account updater, and high-volume payment data pipelines to improve card-not-present approval rates and reduce recurring declines.\n\nToday, I’m the Co-Founder & CEO of Synvra, a compliance-by-design LIMS and validation platform for ISO 17025, GLP/GMP, and FDA 21 CFR Part 11 labs. Alongside Synvra, I’ve spent years working with US-based security vendors such as Barbican LLC and Securencrypt on SOAR, ransomware-focused endpoint protection, and secure data platforms, and I’ve led public-sector work for UNDP/GEF and Pakistan’s Ministry of Climate Change.\n\nAcross these roles, my focus has been consistent: align engineering with business outcomes—approval rates, churn and retention, cost-to-serve, and audit readiness—while building teams and systems that can scale. I’m currently pursuing an Executive MBA at Quantic to deepen the business side of that work.",
